                Former India Opener and Delhi local, Virender Sehwag was accorded the icon player status in the Delhi
                Daredevils team and was also the captain of the side during the first two seasons. However, he resigned
                and passed on the leadership to Gautam Gambhir for the 2010 season. But after Gambhir left the team for
                the Kolkata Knight Riders in the fourth edition, Sehwag was once again given the duty to captain the
                team.
