                Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) is a professional franchise cricket team based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh that

                BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow. The team is owned by RPSG Group, who previously owned the
                Rising Pune Supergiant franchise between 2016 and 2017. The team is captained by KL Rahul and coached
                by Justin Langer. The team mentor is Gautam Gambhir. In its debut season, Lucknow Super Giants

                At the mega auction which was held in February 2022, the team brought many players in which the
                all-rounders were more in numbers. The franchise brought various big international players such as
                Quinton de Kock, Mark Wood, Krunal Pandya, Marcus Stoinis. Later the franchise named KL Rahul as the
                captain of the team and the old Zimbabwean cricketer Andy Flower as the head coach for the upcoming
                season. Franchise also appointed Gautam Gambhir as the mentor of the team. In the initial phase of
                the season all-rounder Marcus Stoinis was not available due to the ongoing Australian series in
                another country. Before the start of the season, it was confirmed that the English pace bowler Mark
                Wood will not be able to join the team because of injury so, the franchise drafted Australian bowler
                Andrew Tye in the place of Mark to fill the requirement of a pace bowler on the team in the first
                season.

                In its first season of IPL, LSG finished third in the table which meant they qualified for the
                playoffs. They faced fourth place Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Eliminator Match and were
                knocked out by them at that stage. In their second season of IPL, LSG again finished third in the
                table, which meant they qualified for the playoffs. They faced fourth place Mumbai Indians in the
                Eliminator Match and lost to them, knocking them out for the second time.
