            <p>The Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), now known as the Punjab Kings, is a franchise cricket team that competes in
                the Indian Premier League (IPL). Established in 2008, the team is based in Mohali, Punjab. KXIP's
                official colors are red and silver. The team is owned by a consortium consisting of Mohit Burman,
                Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta, and Karan Paul. The Punjab Kings have a passionate fan base and enjoy strong
                support from their fans, often referred to as the "Punjabi Lions." The team's home ground is the
                Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. KXIP has had a mix of highs and lows in the
                IPL. In 2014, under the captaincy of George Bailey, the team reached the IPL final but finished as
                runners-up. Over the years, KXIP has had notable players in their ranks, including Chris Gayle, KL
                Rahul, and Glenn Maxwell, who have made significant contributions to the team's success. KXIP has seen
                various changes in leadership, with captains like Yuvraj Singh, David Miller, Ravi Ashwin, and KL
                Rahul leading the team in different seasons. The Punjab Kings have a strong emphasis on nurturing
                young talent and have given opportunities to several budding cricketers. While the team has had its
                share of challenges, KXIP remains a competitive force in the IPL and continues to strive for success.

                The team has also had international stars like Glenn Maxwell and Mohammad Shami, who have made
                significant contributions to their campaign. Despite not clinching an IPL title yet, the Punjab Kings
                have had memorable moments, including scoring the highest-ever IPL team total of 263 runs in 2011.
                With passionate fans supporting them, the Punjab Kings continue to strive for success and aim to
                secure their maiden IPL championship.
